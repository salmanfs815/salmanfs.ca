It's imperative that every software developer begins any new venture with a "Hello World" program. In the case of learning a new programming language, that program rarely reaches beyond a single personal computer screen. Perhaps this blog will reach a wider audience than just my own screen so hopefully this is a more meaningful "Hello, World."

I'm not exactly sure why I'm starting this blog to begin with so let's just see where this goes. I'm hoping to write about all sorts of stuff: life, religion, programming, work. Maybe occasional political thoughts or other random stuff.
