Meh.

That should just about sum up my thoughts... It was nice, but I prefer Vancouver. I've lived in Vancouver for well over a decade. It's what I consider home. So there is inherently some bias when I say Vancouver is better than Toronto.

Overall, it was a great experience. Stretching out of my comfort zone, making some new friends, connecting with family and pretending to be a tourist for a rather lengthy period of time.

The weather wasn't bad. I enjoyed the winter. Finally got to see some real snowfall. Summers were bearable but a bit too warm and humid for my liking.

TTC, which was part of my daily commute, was surprisingly decent given the abundance of dissatisfaction expressed by countless Torontonians. Delays are common, and can be lengthy, especially on the subway. The tap stations for PRESTO cards break down frequently (which saves me money so I'm not complaining). But besides that, not bad! However, service doesn't extend outside of the City of Toronto so any inter-city travel will require paying fares for multiple transit agencies. Or using the expensive, although quite luxurious, GO network of buses and trains which makes regional transportation rather comfortable.

Driving in the city seems to be quite painful. Bumper to bumper traffic during rush hour. Plenty of potholes. But the roads are spacious (think Surrey, but bigger). I also recently came to learn that Hwy 401, which stretches from Windsor to Montreal, is the busiest highway in North America and the world's busiest truck route. At its widest point, it has [18 lanes](http://i.imgur.com/K7DfQYg.png).

Similar to the lack of snow-preparedness in Metro Vancouver, GTA is ill-equipped for rain. Sidewalks panels are often submerged in water and [flooding isn't uncommon](https://toronto.citynews.ca/video/2019/07/17/drivers-rescued-by-fire-crew-after-torrential-rain-floods-highway-401-ramp/).

What did I miss most about Vancouver? The mountainous views in every direction. The scenic greenery. And of course, the rain!
