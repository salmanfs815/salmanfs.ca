We are now in the days of _tashreeq,_ the final days of the annual pilgrimage. The _hujjaaj_ (pilgrims) are completing the final rituals of _hajj_ in these blessed days. At this time of year I often reflect upon my time in Makkah and yearn to return.

I performed the holy pilgrimage for the first time in 2012 with my family. I was young then, still in high school. It was a very unique experience.

The most memorable experience was seeing the _ka\`bah_ for the time. Someone told me at the time that I should write down how I felt during that first sighting so I could remember that memory later because there's something about the first time that is so mesmerizing. I wish I had taken that advice and written down that experience. I'm going to try to recount and describe that memory:

Our group arrived in Makkah in the evening and went to perform _umrah_ that night. Standing outside _Masjid al-Haraam_ was so beautiful that night. While on the bus, I was getting really hot and sweaty because our _ihram_ garments were basically towels. But now there was a mild cool breeze and the temperature felt just right and the humidity of the daytime was absent. We entered the _masjid_ and offered our _Isha salah_ individually because we had missed the congregation_._ After regrouping, we started walking towards the centre of the mosque. I knew that I should keep my gaze low until the _kabah_ was in clear sight so that I could prolong my very first glance as that is a blessed and _maqbool_ time for _dua_ but I just couldn't resist. I peeked from the side of my eye and realized that I was now facing the _kabah._

It was an incredible sight. The dark nighttime sky was visible above the _mataaf_ and the lights around the _masjid_ were bright but the _kabah_ and the area surrounding it seemed to have its own glow. We were standing in the part of the _masjid_ just outside the main _tawaaf_ area so there was a roof over our heads and our floor was half a flight of stairs higher than the _kabah_ level. The _mataaf_ was tiled with white ceramic so that it wouldn't heat up during the day under the scorching Arabian sun. Near the centre of the _mataaf_ was the _kabah_.

I've seen it in pictures and videos many times before but seeing it before my eyes was just magnificent. It seemed quite larger than I expected for some reason. Towering above those circumambulating it. The cover over the _kabah_ was a deep black with gold calligraphy embroidered around it. Everyone in the _mataaf_ was either moving in harmony around it or praying on the side. The corner with the black stone (_hajr_ _al-aswad_) was pointing towards me but I couldn't see it because everyone was crowded around it. They all slowed down as they passed it, making _istilaam_ and trying to touch it.

On the side to the right of the black stone was _maqaam-e-Ibrahim,_ in front of the door_._ It was on a raised platform, securely surrounded by thick glass. When I looked inside it later, it was difficult to identify the rock and the footprints of Ibrahim (AS).

It was surreal. Everything about it seemed so out of reach just mere month ago. But there I was, ready to fulfil my fifth pillar.

Since then, I have gone for _umrah_. But I guess that first-time experience is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Perhaps it was the _barakah_ of _hajj_.
