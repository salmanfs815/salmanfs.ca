Last weekend's Majlis program at Darul Uloom Canada included a talk by Mufti Husain Memon in which he gave some insights regarding the following ayah of Surah Tawbah:

<img src="/assets/img/blog/quran-009-119.png" alt="Quran 9:119" width="500"/>

Mufti Taqi Usmani translates the above ayah as "O you who believe, fear Allah, and be in the company of the truthful." \[Quran 9:119\]

Mufti Husain divided the ayah into 3 parts.

The first part of the ayah is the address to the believers: a reminder that all Muslims should take heed to what follows.

The second part of the ayah is the command to acquire taqwa. Taqwa has been translated here as "fear \[of\] Allah". Taqwa is about being conscious of Allah's omnipresence. The fear of Allah is actually the fear of displeasing Allah. It is a fear that is grounded in love. It means that one abstains from all things that are displeasing to Allah, afraid that it may compromise one's relationship with Allah. Taqwa has many ranks. The lowest rank is the rejection of shirk (associating partners with Allah). The next rank is abstaining from the impermissible (haraam); and then abstaining from the disliked actions (makruh); and then abstaining from doubtful things; and then abstaining from permissible things out of fear that it may lead to the impermissible (and would hence be displeasing to Allah). The call for taqwa is made in the imperative. This establishes the obligation of everyone being addressed, namely the Muslims, to observe taqwa.

Finally, the third part of the ayah is also a command. It is telling the believers to keep the companionship of people that are truthful. There is ample mention in the hadiths on the topic of keeping good company, for example, the oft-mentioned [comparison of the perfume seller and the blacksmith](https://sunnah.com/muslim/45/189). Prophet Muhammad SAW also said "a man is upon the religion of his friend" \[[Tirmidhi](https://sunnah.com/urn/676820)\] so we should be careful with whom we spend our time because the qualities of our friends will rub off on us.

Further elaborating on the quality of truthfulness, Mufti Husain mentioned that being truthful isn't restricted to speech but it must also be evident through action. For example, one should abstain from creating a business partnership with people that he knows will not deal honestly with customers or will try to evade taxes because that is contrary to truth in deeds. The key to acquiring such companions is to set an example with one's own speech and deeds. Like-minded people will also be interested in befriending someone who values honesty.

Shaytaan preys on people that stray away from the companionship of the truthful just as a wolf preys on the sheep that strays away from the herd. There may be three reasons why the sheep strays from the herd. First, lacking a sense of belonging or feeling disconnected from others in the group. Second, going after food or water. We should be cautious that our greed for worldly things doesn't distract us away from the herd. Third, heedlessness or laziness.

Moreover, if we see someone is trying to keep good company but is struggling, we should try to help them. We should reach out and break the ice so they feel comfortable in those circles. Welcome others with a smile. If someone seems distracted, advise gently. If someone seems remiss, encourage them.
