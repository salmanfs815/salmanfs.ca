I've been meaning to create my own portfolio site for some time now.
It's always the dread of designing front-ends that has kept me stalling.

Related to the topic of design, I came across Jeff Huang's [Manifesto for Preserving Content on the Web](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/)
last week when it was on the front page of [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21840140).
In summmary, he stresses that the key to long-term (10+ years) preservation of web pages is to keep the website easy to maintain.
That means: single-page sites, self-hosted resources, no fancy frameworks and no static site generators.

Keeping Jeff's ideas in mind, I began to design my site.
To make the daunting task more approachable, I decided to follow the advice of keeping the website easy to maintain.
This meant limiting myself to vanilla HTML5, CSS3 and JS (read: no frameworks).
I'd like to focus instead on the content: some semblance of a technical portfolio.
The other benefit of keeping the site static is that it can be hosted for free with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
I also moved my WordPress blog posts to this site since it seemed kinda boring with just the projects.

I know this site will evolve over time so I'm not ready to commit to 10+ years of preservation.
But I do intend to follow most of the seven guidelines in hopes that it will ease the maintenance burden.

I hope to improve the overall design of the site as I learn more about interface designs this semester.
